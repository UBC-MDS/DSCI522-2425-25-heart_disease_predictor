## Data Cleaning Process

In order to prepare the raw heart disease dataset for analysis, 
several cleaning steps were undertaken to 
ensure the data is consistent, complete, and properly formatted. 
These steps include renaming columns, relabeling categorical values, 
and handling missing data. 

Below is a detailed description of each cleaning task performed:

### Cleaning Data
1. **Renaming Columns**:
   The original dataset contained column names that were unclear. 
   To make the dataset more understandable and easier to work with, the column names were 
   renamed to more descriptive, readable terms. 

2. **Relabeling Categorical Variables**:
   Several columns contained categorical data that needed to be relabeled for better interpretability:
   
| **Column Name**              | **Original Values**           | **New Values**                                                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chest Pain Type**           | 1, 2, 3, 4                    | 'Typical angina', 'Atypical angina', 'Non-anginal pain', 'Asymptomatic' |
| **Fasting Blood Sugar**       | 'yes', 'no'                   | 1 (yes), 0 (no)                                              |
| **Resting ECG**               | 0, 1, 2                       | 'Normal', 'ST-T wave abnormality', 'Left ventricular hypertrophy' |
| **Exercise Induced Angina**   | 0, 1                          | 'No', 'Yes'                                                  |
| **Slope**                     | 1, 2, 3                       | 'Upsloping', 'Flat', 'Downsloping'                           |
| **Thalassemia**               | 3, 6, 7                       | 'Normal', 'Fixed defect', 'Reversible defect'                |
| **Diagnosis**                 | 2, 3, 4                       | 1 (presence of heart disease)                                |

   
3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   The raw dataset contained missing values that could interfere with analysis. 
   To address this, all rows with missing values were removed from the dataset. 
   
### Validating Data
   After cleaning, several validation checks were performed to ensure data quality:

   - **Empty Observations**: A check was run to ensure there were no rows where all values were missing.
   - **Missingness Threshold**: Missing values in numeric and categorical columns were validated to 
   ensure they did not exceed the defined thresholds (e.g., no more than 5% missing data in certain columns).
   - **Column Names and Data Types**: The dataset was validated for correct column names and data types 
   (e.g., integer, string, float) to ensure consistency with expectations.
   - **Duplicate Records**: A check for duplicate rows was conducted to ensure that no redundant 
   observations were present.
   - **Outliers and Anomalous Values**: Numerical columns were validated to ensure values fell 
   within acceptable ranges (e.g., age between 0 and 120, cholesterol between 100 and 600).
   - **Correct Categorical Levels**: Categorical variables were checked to ensure they only contained 
   valid values (e.g., 'typical angina', 'normal', etc.).
   - **Class Proportions**: The distribution of the target variable, "diagnosis," was checked to 
   ensure balanced proportions of 0 and 1, within a specified tolerance.
   - **Feature-Label Correlation**: A deep check was performed to ensure that the correlation between 
   features and the target variable ("diagnosis") did not exceed an acceptable threshold (0.9), 
   which could indicate potential data leakage or multicollinearity.
   - **Feature-Feature Correlation**: A check was conducted to ensure no pairs of features exhibited 
   highly correlated relationships that could lead to multicollinearity.
