# Contributing to Heart Disease Prediction Project

This guide outlines how to propose changes or contribute to the Heart Disease Prediction project.

### Fixing Typos

If you spot small typos or grammatical errors in documentation, you can fix them directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the source file.

* **YES**: Edit a comment or documentation block in a `.R` file under the `R/` directory.
* **NO**: Do not edit `.Rd` files under the `man/` directory.

### Prerequisites

Before submitting a pull request (PR), it’s important to first file an issue to ensure the problem is understood and agreed upon. If you've discovered a bug, please create an issue and provide a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) that illustrates the problem.

### Pull Request Process

* **Branching**: We recommend creating a separate Git branch for each pull request (PR).
* **Code Style**: Please ensure new code follows the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org) and PEP8 [style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please don’t reformat code unrelated to your PR.
